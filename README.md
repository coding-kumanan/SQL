## What is Relational DB MODEL 
Developed by E.F. Codd from IBM in the 1970s, he proposed data can be stored in the form of tables. The relational database model allows any table to be related to another table using a common attribute. 
Table is logical structure consist of Row and Colums. Row is also called Records or Tuples. Colums also called artibutes or fields.

Attributes (columns) specify a data type, and each record (or row) contains the value of that specific data type. All tables in a relational database have an attribute known as the primary key, which is a unique identifier of a row, and each row can be used to create a relationship between different tables using a foreign keyâ€”a reference to a primary key of another existing table.
